## New Features

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4836 -->
* Simplify attaching a new cargo project to the plugin project model.
Now it’s possible to invoke `Attach Cargo Project` action for your cargo project from the context menu in the project view.
Also, there is `Attach` action for `Cargo.toml` files in an editor if the corresponding crate is not in the plugin project model.

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4812 -->
* Suggest the proper type of braces while a macro call completion.
For example, now the plugin suggests `{}` for `thread_local` macro instead of parenthesis

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4807 -->
* Support `Show import statements` option in `Find usages` dialog.
The option allows including/excluding `use` items from the results of `Find usages` action.
Note, this feature is missing in CLion

## Performance Improvements

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4877 -->
* Don’t reparse the whole file while typing inside macro calls. This should speed up completion in macro calls in large files

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4875 -->
<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4782 -->
* Slightly improve indexing and type inference performance

* Fix LLDB pretty-printers for `Rc`/`Arc` structs on 2020.1

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4816 -->
* Drop `Remove parentheses from expression` intention and make the corresponding quick fix available only for valid cases (by [@t-kameyama])

## Internal Improvements

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4886 -->
