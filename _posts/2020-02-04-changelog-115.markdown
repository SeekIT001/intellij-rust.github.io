## New Features

* [#4836] Simplify attaching a new cargo project to the plugin project model.
Now it’s possible to invoke `Attach Cargo Project` action for your cargo project from the context menu in the project view.
Also, there is `Attach` action for `Cargo.toml` files in an editor if the corresponding crate is not in the plugin project model.

* [#4812] Suggest the proper type of braces while a macro call completion.
For example, now the plugin suggests `{}` for `thread_local` macro instead of parenthesis

* [#4807] Support `Show import statements` option in `Find usages` dialog.
The option allows including/excluding `use` items from the results of `Find usages` action.
Note, this feature is missing in CLion

## Performance Improvements

* [#4877] Don’t reparse the whole file while typing inside macro calls. This should speed up completion in macro calls in large files

* [#4875], [#4782] Slightly improve indexing and type inference performance

## Fixes

* [#4904] Fix compatibility issues with latest 2020.1 EAPs

* [#4874] Fix LLDB pretty-printers for `Rc`/`Arc` structs on 2020.1

* [#4816] Drop `Remove parentheses from expression` intention and make the corresponding quick fix available only for valid cases (by [@t-kameyama])

* [#4102] Now the Cargo Tool Window is not shown for non-Rust projects

## Internal Improvements

* [#4886] Now TOML plugin is [dynamic](https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/plugin_structure/dynamic_plugins.html).
In the future, it will allow you to install, uninstall and update the plugin without restarting the IDE

* [#4863] Drop support of 2019.2 platform
