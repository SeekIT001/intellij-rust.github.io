## New Features

* Provide common IDE features (highlighting, name resolution, completion, linting, fixes, etc.)
for Rust code snippets in documentation comments.
It should make writing documentation more convenient.
You can disable it via `Preferences | Languages & Frameworks | Rust | Inject Rust language to documentation comments` option

  {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-93/doc-comment-injection" w="700px" %}

* Improve rename refactoring:
  * Correctly handle trait items renaming. Now when you rename trait item
  the corresponding items in trait impls are also renamed and vice versa

    {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-93/rename-trait-item" w="700px" %}

  * Support in-place mode. Previously, it was available only for local variables.
  Now renaming of all Rust items supports this mode.
  You can enable/disable it via `Preferences | Editor | General | Refactorings | Enable in-place mode`

    {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-93/inplace-rename" w="700px" %}

* Auto import improvements:
  * Automatically add trait import while trait method completion.
You can disable it via `Preferences | Editor | General | Auto Import | Rust | Import out of scope items while completion` option

    {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-93/trait-auto-import" w="700px" %}

  * Group auto-inserted `use` item with existing ones by the last component when auto import

    {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-93/group-use-items" w="700px" %}

* Make some improvements of `cargo check` external annotator:
  * Run the annotator in parallel with other analysis.
  Now it should show the corresponding error and warning annotation much faster
  * Add ability to pass arguments to the annotator

* Support multiple patterns in `if let` and `while let` expressions.
See the corresponding [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/57532) for more details

* Extract expected and actual results for failed comparison tests,
so now you can see the difference in a separate window for such tests

* Handle 8-bit and 24-bit ANSI color escapes in console properly.
Primarily it affects cargo console output at Windows, so now it should be colored as expected

* Provide `ref` and `refm` postfix completions (by [@t-kameyama])

  {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-93/ref-postfix-completion" w="700px" %}

* Move some error annotation like `Missing members`, `Unknown member`, etc. into separate `Trait implementation` inspection.
So now it's possible to change attributes (severity, scope, etc.) of these annotations or even disable them via the inspection settings (`Preferences | Editor | Inspections`)

* –êdd `Reformat File with Rustfmt` to Cargo tool window

* New icon for generic toml files

## Fixes

* Highlight more precise ranges of unsafe operations

* Fix `String` and `OsString` GDB formatters for nightly compiler

* Do not annotate functions from extern blocks with `#[wasm_bindgen]` attribute as unsafe

* Correctly apply `Make mutable` quick fix for tuple patterns in function arguments

* Fix false positive error annotation `irrefutable let pattern is experimental` for const patterns

* Correctly invalidate caches for injected Rust code.
It should fix weird bugs with name resolution and type inference in injected Rust code

## Internal Improvements

* Update EAP IDEA & CLion
