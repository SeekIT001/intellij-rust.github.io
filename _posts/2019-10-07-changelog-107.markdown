## New Features

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/3712 -->
* Import unresolved items automatically while code generation by most of common intentions and quick fixes like
`Implement members`, `Specify type explicitly`, `Add remaining patterns`.
Previously, such items were marked as unresolved and had to be imported manually
{% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-107/generated-item-auto-import" w="90%" %}

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4405 -->
* Improve `Find Usages` action for pattern bindings (by [@rrevenantt])

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4403 -->
* Take into account type aliases in `Specify type explicitly` intention (by [@t-kameyama])

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4466 -->
* Now `Create New Issue` action can be found in `Help` menu

## Fixes

* Rename refactoring improvements:
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4127 -->
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4077 -->
    * Fix renaming of [field init](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1682-field-init-shorthand.md) and struct field shorthands (by [@rrevenantt] & [@fan-tom])
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4012 -->
    * Now module rename refactoring correctly applies on all corresponding items: declaration, file, and directory (by [@rrevenantt])

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4493 -->
* Improve performance of file type detection in TOML plugin. Note, optimization works since 2019.3 (by [@valich])

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4416 -->
* Do not show some plugin notifications like `File does not belong to any known Cargo project`,
`No Cargo projects found`, etc. while whole indexing process

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4458 -->
* Fix `Debug` trait name resolution with nightly toolchain.
All plugin features that rely on `Debug` trait like `println` postfix completion also work as expected now

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4454 -->
* Update parsing of [macro 2.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1584-macros.md) according with latest changes in nightly compiler


## Internal Improvements

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4178 -->
