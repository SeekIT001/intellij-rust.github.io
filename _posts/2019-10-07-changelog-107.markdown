## New Features

* [#3712] Import unresolved items automatically while code generation by most of common intentions and quick fixes like
`Implement members`, `Specify type explicitly`, `Add remaining patterns`.
Previously, such items were marked as unresolved and had to be imported manually
{% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-107/generated-item-auto-import" w="90%" %}

* [#4405] Improve `Find Usages` action for pattern bindings (by [@rrevenantt])

* [#4403] Take into account type aliases in `Specify type explicitly` intention (by [@t-kameyama])

* [#4466] Now `Create New Issue` action can be found in `Help` menu

## Fixes

* Rename refactoring improvements:
    * [#4127], [#4077] Fix renaming of [field init](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1682-field-init-shorthand.md) and struct field shorthands (by [@rrevenantt] & [@fan-tom])
    * [#4012] Now module rename refactoring correctly applies on all corresponding items: declaration, file, and directory (by [@rrevenantt])

* [#4493] Improve performance of file type detection in TOML plugin. Note, optimization works since 2019.3 (by [@valich])

* [#4416] Do not show some plugin notifications like `File does not belong to any known Cargo project`,
`No Cargo projects found`, etc. while whole indexing process

* [#4458] Fix `Debug` trait name resolution with nightly toolchain.
All plugin features that rely on `Debug` trait like `println` postfix completion also work as expected now

* [#4454] Update parsing of [macro 2.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1584-macros.md) according with latest changes in nightly compiler


## Internal Improvements

* [#4418] Drop support of 2019.1 platform

* [#4178] Add paragraph about plugin project module to [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md#project-model)
