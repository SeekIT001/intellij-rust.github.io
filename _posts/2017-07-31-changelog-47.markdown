Plugin is now officially supported by JetBrains ðŸŽ‰.

Support for IDEA 2016.3 was dropped, the minimal required version is
2017.1.

By default, `cargo check` is **not** used for on the fly checking due
to performance considerations for larger projects. It is used for
**Build Project** action though (<kbd>Ctrl+F9</kbd>).


## New Features

* More information is present in quick documentation (by [@Undin]).

* Goto definition for local macros (by [@farodin91]).

* Code completion for macros (by [@farodin91]).

* Improvements for type inference of associated types, lambdas and
  iterators.

* Hints for local variables types and parameter names (by
  [@farodin91]). In the first iteration, they can be a little noisy,
  but it is possible to disable them in settings.

* Move left/right action for different lists in the Rust language (by
  [@Undin]),
  [video](https://zippy.gfycat.com/CaringMintyBarnswallow.webm).

* Exit points of functions (`returns`, `?`, result expressions) are
  highlighted (by [@farodin91]).

* Better type inference for loop expressions (by [@Undin]).

* Better completion in `#[Derive]` attribute (by [@Undin]).

* Checkbox to control if code formatter should change punctuation.

## Fixes

* Parameter info appears automatically after completing function.

* Goto super module (<kbd>Ctrl+U</kbd>) works from a method in an
  inherent impl.

* `eprint!` and `eprintln!` macros are treated as formatting macros.

* Run configuration from context for a single function uses a more
  precise matching (by [@la10736]).

* Reformat code does not break `use foo::{self}` (by [@la10736]).

* Renaming module correctly renames the file.


## Internal Improvements

* More compact stub representation (by [@Undin]).

* Add `RsInferenceContext` to infer types for function at a time.

* Completion tests use before/after style, to check caret position as
  well.
