## New Features

* REPL integration improvements:
    * [#4998] Add variables view.
    Now you can see all your local declarations including variables, functions, and structs
    in a special view on the right of the REPL window. The view can be hidden by the special button on the left panel.
    
        {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-120/repl_variables_view" w="700px" %}

    * [#5168] Show icon in REPL console

* [#5204] Highlight exit points inside tail loop expressions. Previously, the whole loop was highlighted  (by [@rrevenantt])

* [#5131] Add Toml plugin icons


## Fixes

* Completion improvements:
    * [#5156] Prefer `Display` over `Debug` in `.println` postfix template.
    Now `42.println<Enter>` creates `println!("{}", 42)` instead of `println!("{:?}", 42)` (by [@Kobzol])

    * [#5149] Fix `.println` postfix template for string variables and byte strings.
    Now it inserts a proper `{}` or `{:?}` marker into `println!` call (by [@Kobzol])
        
    * [#5139] Provide completion for `union` keyword

* [#5143] Insert trailing comma into `match` arms by `Complete current statement` action (by [@Stzx])

* [#5229] Fix file type mapping for Rust file in IDEA 2020.1. This should fix cases when all Rust files are not highlighted

* [#4972] Do not generate useless `match` arm for [irrefutable patterns](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-02-refutability.html) by `Convert if let statement to match` intention (by [@Kobzol])
  
* [#5199] Recognize irrefutable constant patterns.
Now `Convert if let statement to match` intention does not add useless `_` arm when matching a struct or single-element enum (by [@Kobzol])

* [#5144] Do not import inner types of type aliases by `Implement members` intention (by [@Kobzol])

* [#5187] Fix editor notifications blinking during project opening

* [#5179] Fix [local history](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/local-history.html) broken due to our macro expansion

* [#5174] Fix NPE on Rust code with unclosed paren like `let a = (`

* [#5135] Do not add a directory as as [source/excluded](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/content-roots.html) entries if it does not exist

* [#5076] Set `TERM` variable and terminal's width if terminal emulation is enabled

## Internal Improvements

* [#5137] Make 2020.1 main platform for development
