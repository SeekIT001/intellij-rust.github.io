<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4353 -->

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4293 -->
* Support [`--offline`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6934/) Cargo option stabilized in 1.36.
Now, the plugin passes this flag to each Cargo command if `Preferences | Languages & Frameworks | Rust | Cargo | Offline mode` option is enabled.
Previously, the plugin always passes `-Zoffline` instead that works only with nightly builds

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4352 -->
* Various parsing optimization. It should reduce indexing and macro expanding processes duration

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4396 -->
* Support `async` and `try` blocks in lambdas

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4359 -->
* Provide a link to external documentation for non stdlib items

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4287 -->
* Enchant Cargo tool window.
Now it contains `Expand All` and `Collapse All` actions. In addition, action toolbar has the same layout style as other similar tool windows

## Fixes

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4376 -->
* Better type inference of `await` expressions

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4383 -->
* Prevent an infinite recursion during macro expansion

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4374 -->
* Fix `NullPointerException` while parsing of rustc commit date.
Previously, it prevented of correct project metadata update with custom builds of `rustc`

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4336 -->
* Do not add unexpected `;` when `Complete current statement` (add shortcut here) action is invoked (by [@t-kameyama])

## Internal Improvements

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4356 -->
* Update docs about releases

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4357 -->
* Support lazy parsing for macros. In general, it reduces parsing time while indexing
but this improvement doesn't visible for user (comparing with the previous version).
So it's more a proof of concept to make further similar improvements easier
