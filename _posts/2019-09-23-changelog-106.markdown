This is the last release that supports the 2019.1 platform. To receive plugin updates further, please upgrade your IDE to 2019.2.


## New Features

* [#4385] Support 2019.3 EAPs

* [#4353] Implement `Navigation | Implementation(s)` action (<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+B</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd+Alt+B</kbd>) for trait members (by [@rrevenantt])

* [#4293] Support [`--offline`](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6934/) Cargo option stabilized in 1.36.
Now, the plugin passes this flag to each Cargo command if `Preferences | Languages & Frameworks | Rust | Cargo | Offline mode` option is enabled.
Previously, the plugin always passed `-Zoffline` instead that have been working only with nightly builds

* [#4352] Various parsing optimizations. It should reduce indexing and macro expanding processes duration

* [#4396] Support `async` and `try` blocks in lambdas

* [#4359] Provide a link to external documentation for non stdlib items

* [#4287] Enhance Cargo tool window.
Now it contains `Expand All` and `Collapse All` actions. In addition, action toolbar has the same layout style as other similar tool windows

## Fixes

* [#4376] Better type inference of `await` expressions

* [#4383] Prevent an infinite recursion during macro expansion

* [#4374] Fix `NullPointerException` while parsing of rustc commit date.
Previously, it prevented correct project metadata updates with custom builds of `rustc`

* [#4336] Do not add unexpected `;` when `Complete current statement` (add shortcut here) action is invoked (by [@t-kameyama])

## Internal Improvements

* [#4356] Update docs about releases

* [#4357] Support lazy parsing for macros. In general, it reduces parsing time while indexing
but this improvement is not visible to users (in comparison with the previous version).
So it's more a proof of concept to make further similar improvements easier
