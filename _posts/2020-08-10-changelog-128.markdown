## New Features

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5715 -->
* Improve `New project` dialog to support `cargo-generate` templates.
Now a WebAssembly project can be created using the corresponding template (by [@avrong])

    {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-128/cargo-generate" w="700px" %}

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5451 -->
* Add intention to import a qualified path.
Now you can add `use` item for any part of a complex path under the caret (by [@Kobzol])

    {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-128/import-path" w="500px" %}

* `Move` refactoring (<kbd>F6</kbd>) improvements:
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5736 -->
    * Search and update changed references when moving a top-level item.
    Previously, [`Search for references`](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/move-file-dialog.html) checkbox did not work
    and all the references remained the same after refactoring
        
        {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-128/move-update-references" w="600px" %}

    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5484 -->
    * Take re-exports into account when moving a single file

        {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-128/move-reexports" w="600px" %}

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5758 -->
* Provide `true`/`false` completion for boolean values (by [@ozkriff])

    {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-128/bool-completion" w="400px" %}

* Improve `Wrong number of type arguments` inspection
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5811 -->
    * Support `dyn Trait` and `impl Trait` (by [@Kobzol])

    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5306 -->
    * Provide `Add missing type arguments` fix (by [@Kobzol]).
    Currently, the fix adds only type parameters and ignores lifetimes and associated types

        {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-128/missing-type-arg" w="400px" %}

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5643 -->
* Add `Substitute associated type` intention (by [@Kobzol])

    {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-128/subst-assoc-type" w="700px" %}

* Improve struct patterns completion:
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5660 -->
    * Suggest only struct fields while completion in struct patterns (by [@Kobzol])

    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5825 -->
    * Completion for `..` syntax in struct patterns (by [@Kobzol])

* Type inference improvements:    
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5808 -->
    * Infer types for [`associated_type_bounds`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2289-associated-type-bounds.md) rustc nightly feature
    
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5733 -->
    * Infer type for types implementing the `Try` trait when using question mark operator (by [@Kobzol])

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5798 -->
* Add `Main function not found in crate` ([E0601](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html#E0601)) inspection for build scripts

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5747 -->
* Fold external (non-project related) parts of backtraces (by [@Kobzol])

## Performance Improvements

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5790 -->
* Avoid name resolution while checking if an item is public or not. It should slightly improve performance of code insight

## Fixes

* Type inference improvements:
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5841 -->
    * Infer type parameters from associated type bindings
    
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5837 -->
    * Infer types of complex `?` expressions
    
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5824 -->
    * Ignore currently unsupported negative `impl` blocks during type inference.
    Fixes some `Mismatched types` false-positives related to negative `impl`s in stdlib
    
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5812 -->
    * Fix `Self` type substitution in bounds. This fixes some `The trait bound is not satisfied` false-positives
    
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5809 -->
    * Process nested projections during normalization. Fixes type inference of `Pin<&impl Future<...>>` awaiting
    
* Macro expansion improvements:    
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5862 -->
    * Fix `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` during macro call arguments completion
    
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5810 -->
    * Replace `IntellijRustDollarCrate` with a crate name in `Show macro expansion` action
    
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5796 -->
    * Fix name resolution of `$crate` expanded from transitive dependencies
    
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5855 -->
    * Don't skip doc comments provided via macro definition
    
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5777 -->
    * Fix groups substitution in macro expansion

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5857 -->
* Find and replace occurrences located outside a function in `Introduce constant/variable` refactoring (by [@Kobzol])

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5856 -->
* Properly check spelling in lifetimes. Now `'static` is not reported as a typo

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5853 -->
* Fix name resolution of private reexport with `crate::` path

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5849 -->
* Include `RUSTC` in environment when executing Cargo (by [@tamird])

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5842 -->
* Don't show parameter hints for single-parameter closures.
This hint can be returned back by disabling `Show only smart hints` in `Preferences | Editor | Inlay Hints | Rust | Parameter hints`

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5838 -->
* Fix stdlib source paths on nightly. This fixes `Cargo project update failed` error.

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5822 -->
* Don't provide color highlighting while batch code inspection via `Analyze | Inspect Code` action and similar ones. It prevents empty items in `Inspection Result` tool window

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5820 -->
* Suppress `snake_case` naming lint for `#[no_mangle]` extern functions (by [@Kobzol])

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5819 -->

* Fix mod declarations with `#[path = "mod.rs"]` attribute

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5766 -->
* Attach module without a parent to a parent module in `Attach file to module` fix (by [@Kobzol])

* Allow triggering project GitHub workflows from UI

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5793 -->
* Enable GitHub actions to merge PRs

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5782 -->
* Get rid of `PackageOrigin.TRANSITIVE_DEPENDENCY`
