## New Features

* Improve `Use of moved value` inspection:
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4690 -->
    * Take into account macro expansions while analysis
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4687 -->
    * Detect `Use of moved value` error in loops, lambdas and `if` expressions better

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4615 -->
* Make initial REPL integration. You can try it in `Rust Console` tool window.
The current implementation includes syntax highlighting, basic completion and command history.
Under the hood, it uses [`evcxr`](https://github.com/google/evcxr) util, so the integration requires this util to be installed.
If you don't have it yet, the plugin suggests installing it in one click after the first usage of `Rust Console` tool window.
For now, it's disabled by default. To turn it on, you need to enable `org.rust.ide.repl.tool.window` option in `Experimental Features` dialog (by [@dima74])

* Provide detection of importing items with same names
(see [E0252](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html#E0252)) (by [@rrevenantt])

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4619 -->
* Allow to manually choose arguments in `Extract Function` dialog (<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+M</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd+Alt+M</kbd>) (by [@Stzx])


## Fixes


<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4698 -->
* Show cached compilation warnings in `Build` tool window.
Note, `Build` tool window is experimental at this moment.
To turn it on, you can enable `org.rust.cargo.build.tool.window` option in `Experimental Features` dialog

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4696 -->
* Pass `--edition=2018` to `rustfmt` if needed.
It should fix the issue when code with keywords from 2018 edition (like `async` or `await`)
is not formatted by `Reformat File with Rustfmt` action

* Macro support improvements:
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4694 -->
    * Fix matching `$($ e:expr,)+` group in macros

    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4695 -->
    * Produce less unnecessary parens around exprs while macro expansion

    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4689 -->
    * Don't make full revalidate of macro expansions after `Show single step/recursive macro expansion` actions

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4671 -->
* Process default type parameters by `Move type constraint to parameter list` and `Move type constraint to where clause` intentions properly.
Previously, these intentions removed default type parameters (by [@rrevenantt])

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4701 -->
* Fix exception produced by `Reformat Code` action (<kbd>Ctrl+Atl+L</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd+Atl+L</kbd>) while indexing

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4715 -->
* Do not suggest `Put parameters/arguments/fields/variants on separate lines/one line` intentions
for code with comments to avoid generation of broken code (by [@t-kameyama])


## Internal Improvements

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/4704 -->
* Make 2019.3 platform default for development
