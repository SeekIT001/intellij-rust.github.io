This is the last release that supports the 2019.2 platform. To receive plugin updates further, please upgrade your IDE to 2019.3.

## New Features

<!-- TODO -->
* Support coming 2020.1 EAPs

* Improve Rust debugger support with LLDB bundled into CLion 2020.1:
    * Render enums properly
    * Render primitive types properly (e.g. `i32` instead of C-style `int`)
    * Unmangle names inside call stack

## Fixes

* [#4825] Handle `pub` uses properly in `Nest use statements` intention (by [@t-kameyama])

* [#4785] Fix type inference for `Fn` type parameters with multiple bounds.
It fixes the lack of code completion inside a closure call when multiple trait bounds (like `Send + FnOnce`) are used (by [@rrevenantt])

* [#4818] Take into account the builtin implementation of `Clone` and `Copy` traits for array types during type inference.
It fixes type inference of array usages like `[0; 4].clone()` as well as some false-positive error highlightings
related to arrays

* [#4805] Do not suggest `Lift return out` intention on `else if` branch which previously led to invalid code (by [@t-kameyama])

* [#4799] Improve `Edit | Extend Selection` action for Rust and Toml string literals.
Now it's possible to select separate escape symbols and whole string literal without quotes.

* [#4798] Correctly handle single and triple quotes and support escapes symbols in TOML

* [#4776] Fix false-positive [E0277](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html#E0277) in case of non-default trait method with non-sized arguments

* [#4721] Do not indent braces on their own line (by [@srjek])

* [#4834] Provide help page about Cargo Command run configuration in IDEA and CLion

## Internal Improvements

* [#4823] Remove CLion dependencies from `debugger` module.
Previously, `debugger` module used some CLion-related code. Now all such code has been moved into `clion` module,
and `debugger` module only contains native debugger related code.

* [#4784] Rename code fragments consistently.
Plugin build used to fail sometimes due to two different classes named `RsReplCodeFragment`.
So now the generated one will be `*CodeFragmentElement.java`.
