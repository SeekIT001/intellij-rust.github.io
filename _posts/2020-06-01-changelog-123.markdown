This is the last release that supports the 2019.3 platform. To receive plugin updates further, please upgrade your IDE to 2020.1.

## New Features

* Debugger support outside of CLion: 
    * [#5409] Do not interrupt debugging session if debugger is not loaded.
        Now, if your debugger is not loaded or should be updated, the corresponding dialog and debugger loading don't interrupt debugger session and it continues after successful loading.
        Also, there is option to download/update debugger automatically

    * [#5393] Suggest user to install [Native Debugging Support plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12775-native-debugging-support)
    when start debugging in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate    


* [#5399] Add `Replace with block/EOL comment` intentions (by [@Jezza])

* [#5310] Highlight never (`!`) type as exit points (by [@Kobzol])

* [#5273] Show breadcrumbs for control flow constructions like `if`, `match`, `loop`, etc.
You may configure editor breadcrumbs via `Preferences | Editor | General | Breadcrumbs` settings (by [@Stzx])

## Performance Improvements

* [#5438] Optimize module declaration name resolution

* [#5437], [#5362] Slightly speed up macro expansion


## Fixes

* [#5218] Add use declarations to [Rust REPL](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2020/05/whats-new-in-intellij-rust/#rust_repl) commands context.
It enables completion of imported names

* [#5358] Fix false positive `Redundant else` error for slice patterns

* [#5405] Fix struct field name resolution.
Now [`Go to declaration`](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/navigating-through-the-source-code.html#go_to_declaration)
works for destructured fields when using type alias

* [#5445] Fix inlay type hints for type placeholders. Previously, they were wrong in some complex cases

* [#5383] Fix control flow analysis of paren expressions.
Previously, unclosed paren expression led to `IllegalStateException`,
and there were false-positive move errors on paren expressions inside struct literals

* [#5359] Use the proper grammar for path fragments in `macro_rules!`.
Now macro calls with type-like paths (i.e. paths without `::` token before `<`) like `foo!(Foo<u32>)` are expanded properly (by [@mrobakowski])

* [#5356] Fix environment variables for [Coverage runner](https://intellij-rust.github.io/docs/quick-start.html#coverage)

* [#5382] Fix `clippy` and `rustfmt` installation check.
They can be used for [linting and reformatting code](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/rust-support.html#cargo-support)

* [#5408] Fix debugging when terminal emulation is enabled

## Internal Improvements
* [#5470] Improve release actions script
