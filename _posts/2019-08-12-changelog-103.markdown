## New Features

* [#4210], [#4190], [#4183], [#4182], [#4181], [#4179] This update brings a significant performance improvement, like plugin cache subsystem was reworked.
In combination with other micro-optimizations, it greatly speeds up name resolution and type inference.
Note, these changes will have a greater effect on the new experimental macro expansion engine because it's more cache-friendly.
You can turn it on via `Preferences | Languages & Frameworks | Rust | Expand declarative macros` option

* [#4121] Make Toml [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8195-toml) mandatory dependency of Rust plugin.
If you still don't have it, IDE will suggest installing Toml plugin while updating

* Update the [Rust page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/rust-support.html) in CLion help

* [#4194] Support `concat` macro. Now name resolution and completion work for direct arguments of the macro like `env!`. Also, the value of the macro is taken into account while path evaluation inside `include` macro call.
It's yet another step to support code included via macro call like `include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/bindings.rs"))`

* [#4206] Add completion of `const` keyword for [const generics](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2000-const-generics.md)

* [#4195] Associated functions have higher priority than methods in completion list for paths like `module::Struct::`

## Fixes

* [#4175] Fix false positive `Trait objects without an explicit 'dyn' are deprecated` warnings for `Self` type parameters

* [#4226] Fix name resolution of items from [prelude](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html) with nightly compiler

* [#4213] Fix `IndexNotReadyException` while indexing `pub extern crate` items

* [#4177] Correctly insert `use` item by `Auto Import` quick fix inside public inline modules

* [#4202] Fix incorrect name resolution of `const` generic parameters

* [#4184] Correctly set focus on name field in `Extract method` dialog (by [@gejun123456])

## Internal Improvements

* [#4188] Make 2019.2 default platform for development
