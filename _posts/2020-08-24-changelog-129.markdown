## New Features

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5745 -->
* Implement [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/) run configuration.
  So now you can run any `wasm-pack` command just from the IDE

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5645 -->
* Support the `Complete Current Statement` (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</kbd>) action for function and structs (by [@Stzx])

    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5910 -->
    * Create default run configuration for a new project

    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5919 -->
    * Improve package name validation during the new project creation

* Lints & inspections improvements:

    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5889 -->
    * Move all `rustc`-related lints to the newly created separate `Lints` group.
      You can find the corresponding inspection settings in `Preferences | Editor | Inspections | Rust` panel.

    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5891 -->
    * Support the `nonstandard_style` attribute for naming inspections
    
    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5890 -->
    * Now the `While true loop` inspection takes into account the `while_true` lint [level](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html#lint-levels)
      and has the suppression quick fix to add `#[allow(while_true)]` attribute

    <!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5865 -->
    * Check if the `derive` attribute is placed on a supported item (by [@Stzx])

* Suggest the run configuration name from its command

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5828 -->
* Allow folding of consecutive `impl Iterator<Item=X>`s in a method chain hints (by [@Kobzol])

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5760 -->
* Code coverage integration improvements:
    * Allow using any nightly toolchain to run code with coverage
    * Show the error message if a user tries to launch code with coverage without nightly toolchain

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5885 -->
* Update Cargo-related icons

<!-- https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/pull/5873 -->
* Improve autocompletion of the `cargo` command in the [Run Anything](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/rust-support.html#cargo-support) popup

* Don't annotate user-defined attribute macros that override built-in ones (by [@Stzx])
