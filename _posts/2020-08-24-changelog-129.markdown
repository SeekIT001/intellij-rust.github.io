## New Features

* [#5745] Implement [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/) run configuration.
  So now you can run any `wasm-pack` command just from the IDE

* [#5645] Support the `Complete Current Statement` (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</kbd>) action for function and structs (by [@Stzx])

    * [#5845] Provide support for custom project templates in the `New Project` dialog

    * [#5910] Create default run configuration for a new project

    * [#5919] Improve package name validation during the new project creation

* Lints & inspections improvements:

    * [#5889] Move all `rustc`-related lints to the newly created separate `Lints` group.
      You can find the corresponding inspection settings in `Preferences | Editor | Inspections | Rust` panel.

    * [#5891] Support the `nonstandard_style` attribute for naming inspections
    
    * [#5890] Now the `While true loop` inspection takes into account the `while_true` lint [level](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html#lint-levels)
      and has the suppression quick fix to add `#[allow(while_true)]` attribute

    * [#5865] Check if the `derive` attribute is placed on a supported item (by [@Stzx])

* [#5940] Suggest the run configuration name from its command

* [#5828] Allow folding of consecutive `impl Iterator<Item=X>`s in a method chain hints (by [@Kobzol])

* [#5760] Code coverage integration improvements:
    * Allow using any nightly toolchain to run code with coverage
    * Show the error message if a user tries to launch code with coverage without nightly toolchain

* [#5885] Update Cargo-related icons

## Performance Improvements

* [#5926], [#5912] Slightly optimize name resolution in some cases

## Fixes

* [#5877] Don't insert double parentheses for functions and methods after completion

* [#5870] Don't provide the `Change return type` quick fix in a lambda with an implicit return type (by [@Kobzol])

* [#5937] Now the `Attach file to a module` quick fix takes into account existing `mod` items, comments and attributes when inserting the new `mod` item (by [@Kobzol])

* [#5873] Improve autocompletion of the `cargo` command in the [Run Anything](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/rust-support.html#cargo-support) popup

* [#5641] Don't annotate user-defined attribute macros that override built-in ones (by [@Stzx])

## Internal Improvements

* [#5932] Initial regression testing. It should help to catch false-positive errors in new changes automatically

* [#5946] Create a release branch on a schedule from CI
