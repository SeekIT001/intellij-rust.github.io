This is the last release that supports the 2021.3 IDEs. To receive plugin updates further, please upgrade
your IDE to 2022.1.

## New Features

* [#8839] Provide builds for 2022.2 major release

* [#8828] Implement [unsized coercion](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-coercions.html#unsized-coercions) in type inference engine. In particular, this fixes false-positive errors like type mismatch between `Box<[u8]>` and `Box<[u8; 4]>`

## Fixes

* [#8835] Type inference improvements:
  * Infer closure parameters types when a closure is assigned to a variable and parameters types should be inferred later
  * Fix `?` operator with `Try` trait. The (unstable) `Try` trait was moved to `core::ops::try_trait::Try` and its associated types was renamed. Now `?` works for `Poll<Result>`, for example.
  * Fix for loop over type parameter implementing `Iterator`
  * Derive recently added unstable `Destruct` trait for all types. It is used as a trait bound in stdlib

* [#8776] Take into account line breaks when showing `rustfmt` error messages
