This is the last release that supports the 2021.2 IDEs. To receive plugin updates further, please upgrade
your IDE to 2021.3.

## New Features

* [#8438] Enable the `.ref` and `.refm` postfix completions for type references (by [@Kobzol])

  {% include gif-img.html path="/assets/posts/changelog-164/ref" w="700px" %}

* [#8441] Parse  [`inline_const`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/inline-const.html) / [`inline_const_pat`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/language-features/inline-const-pat.html) syntax and annotate them as experimental

* [#8410] Infer type of `&raw const` and `&raw mut` [operators](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2582-raw-reference-mir-operator.html). As a result, the plugin now knows the proper type of `addr_of!` and `addr_of_mut!` macro calls from stdlib

## Fixes

* [#8392], [#8402] Suppress `Unresolved reference` inspection in test mods in packages with cyclic dev-dependencies or if the path qualifier is multiresolved

* [#8146] Take into account const generics in `Wrong generic arguments number` inspection and corresponding quick-fixes

* [#8447] Properly add new module declaration by `Attach file to module` quick-fix if a new module has a keyword-like name

* [#8375] Make `Add missing fields` quick-fix work properly with raw identifiers

* [#8411] Fix adding trait imports for usages in `Extract Trait` refactoring

* [#8408] Fix `Find usages` when usage is in a module with a relative path attribute

* [#8430] Mark usages in [doctests](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/documentation-tests.html) as "Test usages" in IntelliJ IDEA

* [#8292] Improve `Preferences | Editor | Inlay Hints` rendering: drop redundant options and fix wording

* Name resolution improvements:

  * [#8418] Fix resolve of [macros 2.0](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1584-macros.html) in doctests

  * [#8404] Resolve `self` in `use proc_macro_crate::{self}`

  * [#8401] Resolve items inside mods named as primitive types

  * [#8418] Resolve and expand attribute proc macros in doctests

* [#8398] Fix expansion of `pin_project_lite::pin_project` macro inside function bodies

* [#8400] Fix Cargo features inference with [renamed](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#renaming-dependencies-in-cargotoml) packages with hyphens

* [#8376] Fix an exception during a new project creation after dynamic plugin loading

## Internal Improvements

* [#8444] Create a release branch one day earlier, i.e. usually on Monday morning one week before release

* [#8389] Use Java 11 as the target level during compilation and as language level in the project. So now, it's possible to use any Java 11 API
