## New Features

* [#8647] Collapse macro expansion steps into a single one.
It not only fixes blinking UI during macro expansion process but also significantly speeds up the macro expansion itself

* [#8689] Provide file links for `dbg!` macro output in the terminal

## Fixes

* [#8674] `Generate constructor` action now places the cursor after the generated code (by [@Kobzol])

* [#8671] `Import` quick-fix now properly escapes keyword-like identifiers as [raw identifiers](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2151-raw-identifiers.html)

* [#8631] Properly evaluate build scripts even if a package does not have any binary or library targets.
  Note, build script evaluation is disabled by default for now. To turn it on, enable `org.rust.cargo.evaluate.build.scripts` [experimental feature][experimental features]

* [#8692] Update [ra_ap_proc_macro_srv](https://crates.io/crates/ra_ap_proc_macro_srv) lib to 0.0.102 in procedural macro expander.
  It should fix expansion of some procedural macro calls (for example, from [rocket](https://crates.io/crates/rocket) crate).
  Note, procedural macro expansion is disabled by default for now.
  To turn it on, enable `org.rust.cargo.evaluate.build.scripts` and `org.rust.macros.proc` [experimental features]

* [#8666] Fix `NoClassDefFoundError` exceptions in Rider 2021.3 and show debugger settings properly

* [#8683] Properly validate project names containing `.` symbol while creating new Rust projects in minor IDEs like CLion

* [#8555] Parse and highlight headers in doc comments properly

* [#8679] Fix parsing errors when updating local crates index

## Internal Improvements

* [#8684] Make 2022.1 platform default for development
